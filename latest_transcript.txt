ASSISTANT: Hi — I’ll ask two quick questions about how you're doing. Please reply when ready.
USER: (speaks Russian)
ASSISTANT: Do you mean you'd like me to repeat the questions in Russian, or that you're just not ready to answer yet? When you're ready, perhaps a short walk or a cup of tea might help you feel more comfortable.
USER: (footsteps) (background noise)
ASSISTANT: It sounds like you're on the move, so perhaps you could enjoy a little people-watching or a few moments of nature observation along the way.
