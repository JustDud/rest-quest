# ✅ QUICK FIX - Your App is Running!

## 🎉 Good News: Your Server is Running!

The dev server is currently running on:
### **http://localhost:5173**

## 🚀 What to Do Now:

### Step 1: Open Your Web Browser
- Open Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or any web browser
- **DO NOT** try to use the code editor to interact with the app

### Step 2: Go to This URL:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 3: You'll See the App!
- You'll see the first screen: "How does your soul feel?"
- There's a large textarea where you can type
- **Type your feelings here** - this is where you "enter" text!

## ❌ Common Mistake:

**Don't try to:**
- ❌ Open folders in the code editor
- ❌ Type in the code editor
- ❌ Look for input fields in VS Code/Cursor

**Do this instead:**
- ✅ Open your web browser
- ✅ Go to http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Type in the textarea on the webpage

## 🔍 How to Know It's Working:

1. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
2. You should see a light blue background
3. Large textarea in the center with placeholder "I feel..."
4. You can click and type in that textarea
5. After typing 50+ characters, a "Continue" button appears

## 🛠️ If the Browser Shows an Error:

### Check Terminal:
Make sure you see:
```
VITE v5.4.21  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173
```

### If Port is Different:
If terminal shows a different port (like 3002), use that port instead:
- Terminal says: `http://localhost:3002` → Use that URL

## 📱 Quick Commands:

```bash
# If server stopped, restart it:
npm run dev

# Then open browser to:
# http://localhost:5173
```

## ✨ Summary:

**The app runs in your BROWSER, not in the code editor!**
- Code editor = for editing code files
- Web browser = for using the app and typing in textareas

---

**Your app is ready! Just open http://localhost:5173 in your browser!** 🎉
