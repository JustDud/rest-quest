# 🎯 READ THIS FIRST - How to Use the App

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: You Can't Type in the Code Editor!

If you're trying to type in VS Code/Cursor and getting an error about "directory", you're in the wrong place!

## ✅ The Correct Way:

### 1. The App Runs in Your WEB BROWSER
- Not in the code editor
- Not in VS Code
- **In Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or any web browser**

### 2. Open This URL in Your Browser:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. You'll See:
- Light blue background
- "How does your soul feel?" heading
- **A large textarea box in the center**
- **THIS IS WHERE YOU TYPE!**

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions:

### Step 1: Make Sure Server is Running
In your terminal, run:
```bash
cd /Users/alisadergal/hackathon/rest-quest
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
VITE v5.4.21  ready in XXX ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Open Your Web Browser
- Click on Chrome, Firefox, Safari icon
- Or press Cmd+Space and type "Chrome" / "Safari"

### Step 3: Go to the URL
Type in the address bar:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 4: You Can Now Type!
- Click on the large textarea
- Start typing your feelings
- The textarea will accept your input
- After 50+ characters, a "Continue" button appears

## 🎨 What You'll See:

1. **First Screen (Emotional Sanctuary)**
   - Large textarea: "I feel..."
   - You can type here
   - After typing, click "Continue"

## ❌ Don't Do This:

- ❌ Don't look for input in the code editor

## ✅ Do This Instead:

- ✅ Open your web browser

- ✅ Use the app in the browser

## 🔧 If Browser Won't Open:

### Manual Steps:
1. Open any web browser
2. Click the address bar
3. Type: `http://localhost:5173`
4. Press Enter
5. You should see the app!

### Check Terminal:
If you see a different port in terminal:

## 💡 Remember:

**Code Editor = For editing code files**
**Web Browser = For using the app and typing input**

The app is a **web application** that runs in your browser, just like any website!

**Your server is running! Just open http://localhost:5173 in your browser!** 🚀
